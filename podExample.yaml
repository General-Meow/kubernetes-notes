# To run this: kubectl create -f <FILE_NAME.YAML>
# The above creates a pod on the cluster
# find more info on the deployment by using: kubectl get pods --watch
# because pods can only be access within the cluseter you need to create a service or proxy to access it
# to proxy do: kubectl port-forward sa-frontend-pod 88:80
# then go to: 127.0.0.1:88

# You can modify an existing Pod deployement by making the changes to the file then use the apply command:
# kubectl apply -f sa-frontend-pod.yaml
# --show-labels can be used on kubectl get pods: kubectl get pods --show-labels
